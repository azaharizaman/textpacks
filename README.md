# Textpattern CMS language files

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/textpattern-cms-textpacks/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/textpattern-cms-textpacks)

This repository contains Textpacks for [Textpattern CMS](https://textpattern.com). Textpacks are text files containing translated strings, providing internationization support for Textpattern.

## Contributing

Every translated string makes Textpattern better! **Translation of the project is achieved via [Crowdin](http://translate.textpattern.com/)** - the tools they provide make translating as painless as possible. Please create a Crowdin account (it's free), select the language you want to translate to from the listing (they each show the percentage already completed) and off you go!

**Please note that we do not accept pull requests directly to this GitHub repository** (this is just a storage area for the languages generated by our Crowdin build).

## Developer tools

The [tools](https://github.com/textpattern/textpacks/blob/master/tools/) directory contains additional useful tools for Textpattern developers (e.g. tools to find any current language strings in the system that have not had a Textpack language string generated). Please see the [tools README](https://github.com/textpattern/textpacks/blob/master/tools/README.md) for more information.
